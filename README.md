Hi! This is a project developed with the intention to practicing React.js

Nice things that could be learned from this project:

-   Create a React project using the [[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)] template;
- React.js Functional Components;
- React useState and useEffect Hooks;
- React Styled-components;


# Behavior
